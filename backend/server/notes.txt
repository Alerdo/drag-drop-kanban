1. Create the Backend API and Node Server in your React Project:
Firstly, we'll add a backend to your React project.

Initialize Express and Create a Server:

You can create a new directory at the root of your project called server. This is where your server-side code will live.

bash
Copy code
mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y
npm install express sequelize pg pg-hstore
Server Entry Point:

Create a file called server.js in the server directory. This will be the entry point for your server.



app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

2. Create the Database:
use PostgreSQL as the database:

Install PostgreSQL on your machine and start the service.

Create a new database using a GUI tool like pgAdmin or the command line.

3. Create functionality for API calls and interactions with the Database:
Setup Sequelize:

First, initialize Sequelize in your server directory:

npx sequelize-cli init
This will create some folders and config files. You need to modify the config/config.json file with your database credentials.


Create a Model:

Now, let's create a model for your cards. In your terminal:


npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Card --attributes stock_name:string,entry_date:date,due_date:date,type:string,stage:string,primary_analyst:string,secondary_analyst:string,sedol:integer,isin:integer,link_1:string,link_2:string,link_3:string,link_4:string,link_5:string,other:text
This will generate the model and a migration file.

Run the Migration:
 create the appropriate table in your database:

bash

npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
Setup Routes:
FRONT END SETUP:
Frontend State Change Event: When there's a change in your frontend state (e.g., a card is created or moved), we need a function to trigger an HTTP request to the backend which will put records into the database.

Install axios (for making http requests to the api)


Create a routes folder inside the server directory. Inside that, create a file named cards.js. Here, you'll define routes to handle CRUD operations for cards.

4. Use Sequelize for Database Interactions:
In your cards.js routes file:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { Card } = require('../models');

// Fetch all cards
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const cards = await Card.findAll();
        res.json(cards);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error fetching cards', error: error.message });
    }
});

// Add more routes as needed for creating, updating, deleting cards.

module.exports = router;
In your server.js, you need to import and use these routes:

javascript
Copy code
const cardRoutes = require('./routes/cards');

app.use('/api/cards', cardRoutes);
5. Connect React to the API:
In your React components, use axios or fetch to interact with these endpoints:

javascript

// Fetch all cards
fetch('/api/cards')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Use the data (cards) in your React state or wherever needed.
    });



So what I need to set funcinality that transmit the change of the state to the api, and than the api throught the routes will handle CRUD operations for the cards usin sequlize .
